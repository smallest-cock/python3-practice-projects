Accept 2 integers from user input.
Print whether the integers are positive or negative.
Print the number of digits in each.
Print the sum, difference, product and quotient.
Sample:
X: -4
Y: 7
The sign of X is NEGATIVE and contains 1 digit.
The sign of Y is POSITIVE and contains 1 digit.
Sum: -3
Difference: -11
Product: -28
Quotient: -.5714

Calculate the number of BTUs required to make a symmetrically shaped 
room 72°F.  Prompt for the room's length, height, and width in feet, 
and for the current temperature in the room.  Display the number of BTUs
required to heat or cool the room.  Be sure to indicate if the room 
needs to be heated or cooled.  It takes .025 BTUs to cool or heat 
1 cubit foot 1°F.  Round to the nearest Integer.
Sample:
Length: 12
Height: 10
Width: 8
Current Temperature: 75
Number of BTUs to COOL the room: 72

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or 
odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. (Hint: how does an 
even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?)
[Extras: If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different 
message. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it 
num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into 
num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate 
message.]

Take two lists, say for example these two:
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements 
that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your 
program works on two lists of different sizes.
[Extra: Randomly generate two lists to test this]

Write a program that takes a list of numbers 
(for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only 
the first and last elements of the given list. [For practice, write 
this code inside a function that takes a list as an argument and 
returns the new list.]

Write a function that takes an ordered list of numbers 
(a list where the elements are in order from smallest to largest) and 
another number. The function decides whether or not the given number 
is inside the list and returns (then prints) an appropriate boolean value.
