Calculate the number of BTUs required to make a symmetrically shaped 
room 72°F.  Prompt for the room's length, height, and width in feet, 
and for the current temperature in the room.  Display the number of BTUs
required to heat or cool the room.  Be sure to indicate if the room 
needs to be heated or cooled.  It takes .025 BTUs to cool or heat 
1 cubit foot 1°F.  Round to the nearest Integer.
Sample:
Length: 12
Height: 10
Width: 8
Current Temperature: 75
Number of BTUs to COOL the room: 72

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or 
odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. (Hint: how does an 
even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?)
[Extras: If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different 
message. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it 
num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into 
num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate 
message.]
