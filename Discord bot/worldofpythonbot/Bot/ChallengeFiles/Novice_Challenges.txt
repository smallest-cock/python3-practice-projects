Take a list, say for example this one:
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that 
are less than 5. [Extras: (1) Instead of printing the elements one by 
one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this 
list in it and print out this new list. (2) Write this in one line of 
Python. (3) Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains 
only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that 
number given by the user.]

Input two letters.  If the first letter comes before the second letter 
alphabetically, then display all the letters between them in proper 
order.  Otherwise, display them in reverse order.
Sample:
First Letter: D
Second Letter: H
DEFGH  # prints this
First Letter: L
Second Letter: E
LKJIHGFE  # prints this

Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or 
not. (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has 
no divisors). Take this opportunity to practice using functions.

Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string 
containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, 
except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the 
string:
  My name is Michele
Then I would see the string:
  Michele is name My
shown back to me.
