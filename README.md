# python3-practice-projects

These are the practice projects that I've completed along the way while learning Python 3.
Many of these projects are taken from the book *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart.
Others are from project challenges posted in the World Of Pyrthon discord server, which have been
taken from various sources.

These may be helpful project examples for someone learning Python 3.
